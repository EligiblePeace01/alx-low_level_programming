# alx-low_level_programming


Every folder in this repository provides an example of a fundamental programming idea that is unique to the C programming language. Concepts like pointers, recursion, malloc, free, structures, function pointers, variadic functions, linked lists, etc. are referenced in the file names. These directories include files with bash scripts and functions related to that specific idea. Some functions (such as _strcpy, _strlen, etc.) are copies of counterparts available in the C standard library.
